<h1>Privacy Policy – FairSplitly</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 2026</p>

<p>
FairSplitly respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled
when you use the FairSplitly application.
</p>

<h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
<p>
FairSplitly does not require account creation and does not directly collect personal
information such as name, email address, or contact details.
</p>
<p>
However, the app displays advertisements provided by third-party advertising services
(such as Google AdMob). These services may automatically collect limited non-personal
information, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Device identifiers</li>
  <li>Approximate (non-precise) location</li>
  <li>Ad interaction data</li>
</ul>
<p>
This information is used solely for displaying and measuring advertisements, in accordance
with the advertising provider’s privacy policies.
</p>

<h2>2. Advertisements & In-App Purchase</h2>
<p>
FairSplitly includes banner and interstitial advertisements.
</p>
<p>
Users may optionally remove all advertisements permanently through a one-time in-app
purchase (“Remove Ads”).
</p>
<p>
When ads are removed, no advertisements are shown and no advertising-related data is
processed.
</p>

<h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
<p>
All expense data, participant names, and calculations are stored locally on the user’s
device only. This data is not transmitted to external servers.
</p>

<h2>4. Analytics & Tracking</h2>
<p>
FairSplitly does not use custom analytics tools, does not track users across apps or
websites, and does not sell or share user data with third parties or data brokers.
</p>
<p>
Any advertising-related data processing is handled solely by the advertising provider and
only when ads are enabled.
</p>

<h2>5. Permissions</h2>
<p>
FairSplitly does not request access to sensitive device features such as camera,
microphone, contacts, or precise location.
</p>

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
FairSplitly does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age
of 13. Advertisements are delivered in compliance with applicable child protection
regulations.
</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected within
the app or on the App Store page.
</p>
